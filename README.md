# Textbook Notes and Solutions
I often read through textbooks in my spare time, writing up my notes in Latex. This repository is a way to keep all that organized. This repository is *not* meant to help with homework, and I make no guarantee that any of my solutions are even correct. 

The notes here are only a portion of what I have; many of my solutions are in Word documents from before I began using Latex. These will be transferred over to Latex, cleaned up, and uploaded at a later date.
