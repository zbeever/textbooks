## Notes and Textbook Solutions
I often read through textbooks in my spare time, writing up my notes in Latex. I also like to collect my thoughts on various technical subjects. This repository is a way to keep all that organized. This repository is *not* meant to help with homework, and I make no guarantee that any of my solutions are even correct. 

The documents here are only a portion of what I have; many of my notes and solutions are in Word documents from before I began using Latex (including the majority of *Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur* by Lancaster and Blundell and *Spacetime and Geometry* by Sean Carroll). These will be transferred over to Latex, cleaned up, and uploaded at a later date.
