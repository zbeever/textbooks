	\begin{questions}
		\question Can you explain this vanishing? Recall the $4$-dimensional notion of `divergence' described in $\S19.3$; here we need the $3$-space version. \textit{Hint}: See Exercise [19.2].
		
		\begin{solution}
			Since we are concerned with the case where no sources are present, Gauss's law for the electric field is $0$. The divergence of the magnetic field is always taken to be $0$.
		\end{solution}
